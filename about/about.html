        'The Golem, The Hound, The Seer' asks the urgent question 'What could Human-AI coexistence look like?'. 
        It takes the form of a musical performance/play/experience that aims to go beyond the myths of the 'AI as evil subjugator' as well as 'AI as technological saviour of humanity' 
        and explores new ones. The project is a space for the audience to reflect on these apocalyptical/utopic models and offers alternative perspectives.

        Ancient myths sought to explain natural phenomena that were beyond human comprehension. 
        Similarly to mythological characters, artificial intelligence (AI) involves concepts that are difficult for humans to understand or explain, and both often invoke fear or awe in those who encounter them. 
        In many ways, AI is like a modern-day mythological creature: its powers are often exaggerated, it is surrounded by speculation and conjecture, and sometimes it is worshipped as a god. 
        Furthermore, the myths surrounding AI often focus on its potential for evil or destruction, in the same way monsters and otherworldly creatures of folklore threaten the well-being of humans, are driven by mysterious motivations, and have the power to change the world. 
        But just as the gods can be life-giving and compassionate, so too can AI.
